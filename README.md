Contains a copy of my `home/` directory but only includes certain customization and configuration files for Ubuntu system. It also includes source papers and documentations related to research. Everything else is excluded. 

The purpose is to securely store the required files online so that they do not need to be redownloaded and renamed, or copied/reconfigured for every machine or everytime when needed. Rather, a simple `git push`/`pull` suffices.
