# `bamr` 
___
#❓ Fix $M_\mathrm{min}$: `m_grid` starts from 0.2$M_\odot$ and `mean_<pop>` from 0.5$M_\odot$. Which number to be used?
#✏️ 0.2$M_\odot$ for `m_grid`, as it is. And set $M_\mathrm{min}$ = 1$M_\odot$ for $M_\mathrm{star}$. 

#❓ Fix $M_\mathrm{max}$: Free parameter with a prior? How/where to compute it? 
#✏️ Not a free parameter. It's computed in the code and to be left as it is. Reject MC if $M_\mathrm{star}>M_\mathrm{max}$ in `bamr_class::compute_point()`. 

#❓ What to do with the acol command: `average-rows` (`o2 -help average-rows`)? Can't remember.

#❓ What to do about the HMXBs? Keep or remove them? Now or later?
#✏️ Abandon them completely.

#❓ Make posteriors of true masses of individual pop stars? Ask how to do this.
#✏️ They are histograms normalized to unity.

___
#📌 Check the validity of all columns (in output table) with Andrew in the next meeting.

#📌 Reject MC if $M_\mathrm{star}>M_\mathrm{max}$ in `bamr_class::compute_point()` and check the code with Andrew.

#📌 Remove columns `wgt_<star>` from output table and add (for now) `M_max2` from `model::compute_star()`.
