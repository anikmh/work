#‚ùì Implement the integral constraints from [Komoltsev and Kurkela (2022)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.05350.pdf) into `bamr`? How? Do we have or can we get EoS in the form $n(\mu)$? 

#‚ùì Why do [Komoltsev and Kurkela (2022)](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.05350.pdf) call $n(\mu)$ the "full" EoS? What are we missing in $P(\epsilon)$? What are the advantanges/disadvantages of using $n(\mu)$/$P(\epsilon)$?

#‚ùì Imposing new constraints can affect ongoing MCMC simulation. Start over or just continue?

#üìô Models `new_poly` and `new_lines` have different column names for some EoS parameters: `exp1`/`exp2`/`exp3` becomes `csq1`/`csq2`/`csq3`. This causes problem in concatenating data files and in building emulator. How to address this?
