#❓ Can we use more threads for faster equilibration time for the next runs? Use a supercomputer e.g. Isaac/NSF?
#✏️ Maybe, but there is another new desktop coming. Also, `new_poly` needs to run again. So, 3 threads for `new_lines` and niced 3 threads for `new_poly`. 

#❓ `models.cpp`: line 222, add `|| model_type==((string)"new_lines"` to the `if` condition?
#✏️ Yes, done.

#❓ Removing `wgt_<sources>` can break `bamr` because it's used in `bamr_class::compute_point()`.
#✏️ Keep it.

#❓ Check all columns of output table with Andrew. 
#✏️ M_max2 is added to table. ed_max (actually e_max) is already there. Nothing else to add, for now.
