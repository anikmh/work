#📓 Observed return codes with their occurance rate:
 - `ix_mr_outside=2`: ~ 0.01% (doesn't occur until much later)
 - `ix_small_max=10`: ~ 2%
 - `ix_eos_acausal=13`: ~ 6%
 - `ix_eos_pars_mismatch=15`: ~ 14%

#❓ Add all quantities to output, both before and after modifying parameters in Sarah's section (set->mmax_deriv=true)? All checks are repeated afterward. 
#✏️ 

#❓ What to do about too many output quantities? Mapping of 91 $\to$ 100+ is not suitable for minimizing loss function.
#✏️  

#❓ Hold on to adding/removing columns to table for now? Already have training data from multi-threaded run on Neutrino. Doing so requires restarting MCMC once again.
#✏️  

#❓ Access to ~~Isaac ACF/NG cluster~~ and/or Isospin GPU? Want to use Jupyter notebook for tuning/optimizing DNN, preferably with GPU. Requires `tensorflow`, on either Isospin GPU with `anaconda3` package or ~~Isaac CPU as before~~.

# `bamr`
#❔ What to make of the upward trend of `log_wgt` plot? Approaching equilibrium? 
#🖋️ 

#❔ In `bamr_class::compute_point()`: if `M_chirp_det`, `q`, `Lambdat` outside range, set ligo_prob=-800 but don't reject - why not? 
#🖋️ 

#❔ In `model::compute_star()`: if `ed_i<ed_max` and (`cs2` infinite or `cs2<0`), then exit - why not just reject?
