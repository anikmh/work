#❓ What is the relationship between our EOS and (1) $\chi$EFT, and (2) QMBPT?
#📓  Our zero-temperature EOS is $\epsilon=-P+\mu n$ 
___
#❓ Which nucleon-nucleon interaction are we connected to? 
#📓 We consider 2-body nuclear interactions between protons and neutrons in beta equilibrium. 
___
#❓ What are common alternatives used for EOS parametrizations?
#📓 
___
#❓ What are the advantages and disadvantages of our prior choices?
#📓 Our priors are all uniform/flat. This choice prevents biases and requires no further parametrizations. It also reflects our lack of knowledge of the distributions of parameters. However, flat priors can cause significantly longer equilibration time.
___
#❓ What have we assumed about NS masses?
#📓 We assumed that NS masses are constants and independent of time. They do not undergo evolution in the form of e.g. accretion or decay. Moreover, each NS mass is independent of the others with the exception of GW19.
___
#❓ How could we redo this project if we had infinite resources?
#📓 We could add more stars to the existing populations, study the population NS-BH, and add more GW data with growing numbers of observations. We could also consider rotating and deformed NS, finite-temperature EOS, and evolution of NS mass distributions. 
___
#❓ What will our work say about the EOS of dense matter and the NS mass-radius curve compared to what others have done?
#📓 
___
#📌 What do phase transitions mean for nuclear matter in NS? Relationships between strong vs. weak and 1st vs. 2nd order transitions.
